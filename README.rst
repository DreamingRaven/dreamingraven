PhD AI, MLOps, Director, and Cypherpunk
=======================================

PhD computer science graduand and `director for Deep Cypher Ltd. <https://deepcypher.me>`_.

I am a pretty-hardcore into my Linux, Kubernetes, and deep learning. I build platforms with Kubernetes to enable AI, as well as building the AI itself which at scale can be quite problematic.
I play the long game, as building these sorts of platforms is not a short gentle stroll, but a marathon! I solve problems as far ahead in the future as I can both perceive and expect, in the aim that they never become experienced problems.

I am an avid homelabber, where I experiment with my tooling, and expand my horizons of understanding as I am always learning, adopting new techniques and technologies early. My long term goals are to build and run my company full-time, and become top in my field for deep learning and AI platforms.

Primary research:

 - Deep Learning for agricultural yield prediction.
 - Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), and encrypted deep learning as a service (EDLaaS).
